What is the internet?

*“The internet does not exist. Maybe it did only a short time ago, but now it remains as a blur, a cloud, a friend, a deadline, a redirect, or a 404. If it ever existed, we couldn’t see it. Because it has no shape. It has no face, just this name that describes everything and nothing at the same time.”* -- Vidokle, Anton, Brian Kuan. Wood, and Julieta Aranda. Introduction. *The Internet Does Not Exist*. Berlin: Sternberg, 2016.

Shira Feldman and I are trying to find out what the internet means to its users/inhabitants/beings via text analysis of tweets. 

Phase 1 (currently): Store the tweets (text) and their metadata (id, author, datetime, location). Call the Twitter Search API every 15 minutes using Cron and write the data into a SQL database.
